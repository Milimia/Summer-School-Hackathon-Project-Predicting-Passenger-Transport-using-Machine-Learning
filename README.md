# Summer-School-Hackathon-Project-Predicting-Passenger-Transport-using-Machine-Learning
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for my summer school hackathon project, where I developed a machine learning model to predict passenger transport needs based on various factors.

## Key Features
--Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for machine learning tasks.
--Feature Engineering: Engineered new features and handled categorical data using one-hot encoding and imputation techniques.
--Model Training: Trained a RandomForestClassifier to predict passenger transport requirements.
--Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

## Technologies Used
--Python
   --Pandas
   --Scikit-learn
   
## Files Included
--train.csv: Training dataset used for model training.
--test.csv: Testing dataset used for predictions.
--main.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
--submission.xlsx: Excel file containing predictions for the test dataset.

## How to Use
--Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Milimia/Summer-School-Hackathon-Project-Predicting-Passenger-Transport-using-Machine-Learning
--Navigate to the project directory: cd summer-school-hackathon
--Install dependencies: 
    --pip install pandas, scikit-learn
--Open and run main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred environment.
Explore the code, experiment with different models or parameters, and contribute to further improvements!

## Results
Achieved a training accuracy of 0.9888 % on the dataset.
Detailed performance metrics and insights are available in the main.ipynb notebook.

## Future Improvements
--Incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques.
--Enhance model robustness and scalability for larger datasets.
